Howdy [[EMAIL]],

You need to confirm your [`spore`](http://spore.sh) account on [[HOST]] before you can grant memberships to other users, or accept granted memberships.

To confirm your account, copy and paste the below into your shell:

```
spore verify [[TOKEN]]
```

If you don't have the Spore command line tool installed, install it with the following command:

```
curl install.spore.sh | sh
```


Let us know if you have any issues -> https://github.com/spore-sh/spore-pod
